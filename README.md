# Number-guess-project
# My code for a 'guess the number' game

Here, we ask the player their name and if they want to play.
We then ask the player to guess a randdom number between 1 and 10. if they guess correctly they win the game. If they guess incorrectly they are told oif the rndom number is high or lower than their guess and they guess again. 

the number of attempts is recorded and relayed to the player. A record of attempts taken in each game is also recorded so the player can see how few attempts they need to take to become the champ and take home the trophy!
